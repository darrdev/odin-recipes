        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> The brisket is seared in a hot skillet, then topped with sliced onions and garlic, 
            then braised for about 6 hours for a tender, juicy roast. It's so worth the wait!
        </p>
        <p>Corned beef is a beef brisket (a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest) that 
            has been cured in a salt solution. "Corning" results in intensely flavorful, 
            super tender meat. In this recipe, the corned beef brisket is seared in a hot skillet 
            and then braised all day with garlic and onions for a melt-in-your-mouth texture and 
            perfect flavor.
        </p>
